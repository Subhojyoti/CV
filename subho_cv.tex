\section{RESEARCH PROJECTS}
%\par 
%\textbf{Efficient Clustered UCB}\\
%Presented a novel algorithm for the stochastic multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem. Our proposed Efficient Clustered UCB method partitions the arms into clusters and then follows the UCB-Improved strategy with aggressive exploration factors to eliminate sub-optimal arms, as well as entire clusters. Through a theoretical analysis, we establish that our method achieves a better gap-dependent regret upper bound than UCB-Improved and MOSS algorithms.
\par 

\textbf{Augmented UCB}\\
Proposed the Augmented-UCB (AugUCB) algorithm for a fixed-budget version of the thresholding bandit problem (TBP), where the objective is to identify a set of arms whose quality is above a threshold. A key feature of AugUCB is that it uses both mean and variance estimates to eliminate arms that have been sufficiently explored. This is the first algorithm to employ such an approach for the considered TBP.
\par

\textbf{Efficient UCB-Variance}\\
Presented a novel algorithm for the stochastic multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem. Our proposed Efficient UCB Variance method, referred to as EUCBV is an arm elimination algorithm based on UCB-Improved and UCBV strategy which takes into account the empirical variance of the arms and along with aggressive exploration factors eliminate sub-optimal arms. Through a theoretical analysis, we establish that EUCBV achieves a better gap-dependent regret upper bound than UCB-Improved, MOSS, UCB1, and UCBV algorithms. EUCBV enjoys an order optimal gap-independent regret bound same as that of OCUCB and MOSS, and better than UCB-Improved, UCB1 and UCBV.
\par

\textbf{Aggregation of Experts}\\
We study a variant of multi-armed bandits where arms are non-stationary but predictable. The basic idea is to combine change-point detection algorithm with aggregation of expert strategies in order to define efficient pulling strategies in context of bandits with change of distributions. We focus on the guarantees of prediction error for each arm derived from theory, and on the problem of learning adaptively a representation of signal from a practical point of view.
